"""
Skeleton test for safety guard precision/recall on the labeled gold set.

Wire your safety guard import and remove the @pytest.mark.skip decorator.
Thresholds (from ASSIGNMENT.md):
  - ≥ 95% recall on harmful queries (should_block=true)
  - ≥ 90% pass-through on educational queries (should_block=false)

The safety guard runs synchronously with no LLM call, so this test does NOT
need mock_llm.
